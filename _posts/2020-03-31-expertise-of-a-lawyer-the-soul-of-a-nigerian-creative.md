The creative space over the years has evolved and grown to be one of the most sought after spectrum by teeming youths. With the avalanche of talents and creativity saturating the industry at the moment, it is safe to say that in Africa the Nigerian creative lens will flourish globally.

However, this industry which has enjoyed providence ingrowth had been riddled with a mirage of challenges which ranges from: contract based issues, to intellectual property, management, profit sharing clause to mention a few. The smile injectors in the society have been slapped hard with the above mentioned issues as they continuously give their best to keep the audience entertained and to maintain global reckoning.

It is important to note that there is no industry void of challenges, however, some issues issue are caused by slip-shod attitudes, structure less industry and zero or ineffective policies to mention a few. A fast rising lawyer, Busa Inem, Esq. who has wealth of experience with legal activities in the creative industry, lamented in a discussion, on the carefree attitude of artists towards contract as they ink the dotted lines. The smile for the camera is often a charade in the industry: the inferno will only appear in no distant time.

The entertainment industry has been rocked with legal cases and situations that are aimed at exploiting content creators. Culture reporter, Joey Akan, in his report “How Nigerian artists are underpaid by local digital distribution companies and system” published 2017, succinctly discussed the illegalities and exploitative tendencies suffocating the industry practitioners.

Legal impassivity is perceived across other sectors in Nigeria but rampant in the creative sector. Despite warnings from experienced practitioners to younger breeds in the industry, the vulture still preys on the naivety of these green hons. 

## **Way Forward**

As we begin to ask questions on how to properly protect intellectual property, claim ownership and other activities in the entertainment sector, we must consciously inculcate the legal culture.  Desired results will not be enjoyed if the much needed mechanisms are not put in place. 

Conclusively, we must understand that our crass knowledge on “drafting contract” cannot merge the expertise of a lawyer, hence, the need to properly accommodate lawyers in a thriving business and the hope for some youths.
