We are meant to rescue each other,not cut down the forest to rescue one.

Over the years I have heard stories of injured personâ€™s who die from their injuries because a medical institution refused to administer treatment ( at least first aid) to them for failure to provide a police report or any document as the case may be. Few years ago a neighbor of ours was attacked by armed robbers and was immediately rushed to a hospital in Abeokuta (name withheld) he was not attended to because those who took him to the establishment could not provide a police report to explain the cause of the gunshot, the said man died while he was being transported to another medical institution.

Recently, there was a cry out for justice on the popular social media platform (Twitter) for a particular lady called Moradeun who was stabbed in the neck during a robbery incident but was refused treatment by a nearby hospital because of the inability of the good samaritans who helped her to produce a police report and she died as a result.

The medical profession is guided by laws in Nigeria which all medical practitioners must follow in the course of performing their duties as it relates to the profession, a quick research explains that the medical profession is governed by the National Health Act of 2014 and the Medical and Dental Practitioners Act Cap M8 2004 amongst others. For further clarifications  the Compulsory Treatment and Care for Victims of Gunshot Act 2017 explains what to be done in cases of wounds gotten from gunshots.

A perusal of the former explains that no medical institution shall reject any person in cases of emergency. Section 20 of the National Health Act 2014 says:

Sub 1: A health care provider, health worker or health establishment shall not refuse a person emergency medical treatment for any reason.

The act for a further to explain the punishment for refusing a person for emergency treatment in sub-section 2 

Sub 2: A person who contravenes this section commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of #100,000 or to Imprisonment for a period not exceeding 6 months or to both.

These explains that emergency treatment is a right for users and an obligation that must be performed by either the health worker or health establishments.

In cases of wounds sustained from discharge of firearms, the Compulsory Treatment and Care for Victims of Gunshot Act explains in details what needs to be done by both the health establishments.

Section 1 explains that every hospital shall with or without police clearance receive any person for immediate and adequate treatment be it a private or public establishment, this is a right not a privilege.

As far as the act is concerned all that needs to be done by such establishment is to inform the nearest police station that they receive someone with a gunshot wound for treatment within two hours (Sec 3(1) ). The police will then investigate to determine the circumstances in which the said person was shot (Section3(2) ). Failure of the hospital to report to a police station then attracts a penalty.

Section 9 of the same act explains in detail that any person who commits an offence under this act which leads to substantial,physical,mental,emotional and psychological damage commits an offence liable to conviction to imprisonment of not more than 15 years and not less than 5 years without the option of fine.

This brings me to ask all health establishments in Nigeria the question which needs urgent answer ; Why do you allow people die from injuries or wounds because of failure to provide a police report? Does your establishment not value lives? Does the Hippocratic oath not exist anymore?

It is high time the law enforcement agencies, affected persons and the general public started making all erring health establishments pay for their lackadaisical and unethical attitudes towards persons who need urgent medical attention to injuries sustained whether by gun shot or by any other means. Some establishments should be punished accordingly as it will serve as a deterrent to orders.

Of course after a life is lost what the bereaved want to do is just move on and heal from the loss, no one cares about pressing charges or what have you afterall the deed is done but does that mean the law enforcement agencies and governing bodies of the medical profession should fold their hands while we loose our friends,family,neighbors and or fellow citizen because of the unethical or lawlessness of medical practitioners?

Every health worker and establishment in Nigeria be it private or public needs to be reminded that ignoring a person who needs urgent medical attention because of a police report puts such persons in danger and it is against the laws guiding the profession.

The world needs people who save lives and not professionals who contribute to death of persons.
