### The 865k nation

The conjugality that brought about Nigeria is an antithesis to the ubiquitous practice of marriage rites ingrained in the divergent cultures in Nigeria. The discovery of oil palm in the Niger region of Nigeria around 1886, by Royal Niger Company which now bears the name Unilever Nigeria Plc., began the mapping of what will later be called Nigeria. According to historians, following the revocation of the Royal Niger charter, the Company sold its holdings to the British government for 865,000 pounds an equivalent of 421,941,464.00 naira using the exchange rate as at when the article was written. Due to the rich and diverse mineral resources in Nigeria, the nation first came across as a commercial entity and a resourceful establishment for the British during their industrial revolution.

Nigeria was first officially consummated and birthed when Lord Lugard’s British Frontline Soldier decimated and defeated the North kingdoms; this led to the eventual unification of the South and the North. The unification of Northern and Southern Nigeria in 1914, otherwise known as amalgamation was without due consultation and proper consideration of the indigenes, which bear different colorful armour as their way of life. Nigeria is popularly described as a heterogeneous entity, a multi-national nation with eclectic way of life, belief, language, ideology and religion.

After years of British rule, Nigeria gained independence on October 1st, 1960 giving room to self-made leadership and rulership. The first set of political leaders to hold sway are: Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa and Ceremonial President Nnamdi Azikwe serving as the very focal point of leadership. Other notable leaders included: Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Premiere of the Western region and Opposition leader; Professor Ita Eyo, leader of the National Political Party (NPP); Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto and leader of the Nigerian People’s Congress (NPC); Jaja Anucha Wachuku, the First Speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives and First Minister for Foreign Affairs

An attempt at self-governance free from the strings of the Western World was short-lived by the first coup, spearheaded by Major Kaduna Chukwuma Nzeogwu and Emmanuel Ifeajuna-led military junta, which  deposed Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa’s administration on, January 15th, 1966. The first military coup was buried barely six months after it held sway leading to various putsches and palace coup. Giving their explanation for usurping power, they described democratic leaders as corrupt.  However, they flocked in the style of the birds they criticized and ruled with much highhandedness and despotism.

Nigeria’s first military coup injected bad blood into the multi-national structure of the country, it woke up the silently sharp regional differences, reechoed regional insecurity, separatist and secessionist movements from various regions, second classism, the need for economic sharing formula amongst many more daunting challenges. The most notable of these, is the 1967 Civil war between Government of Nigeria and secessionist State of Biafra; a bedlam that led to carnage in Eastern Nigeria. Asides this gory occasion, Nigeria has faced other historic inter and intra-regional instability and war-like crisis.

In most quarters, it is believed that providence is the reason a heterogeneous set up like Nigeria hasn’t broken up, despite raging challenges. After spate of military interjections, the nation witnessed the longest run of democracy from 1999 till date, but beyond the wars, accusations and counter accusations has played a prominent role in the present society.

Preeminent in the after-war blame is the sharp differentiation in the regions (East, North, West, South South and Middle Belt) when issues arise, an age long situation, as old the nation itself or evenolder.While we celebrate over twenty years of uninterrupted democracy, it is obvious that some underlying issues are weakening the foundation of the nation; top on the list is ethnic bigotry and historic intra-tribal crisis. Whilst giving room to emotions from time to time on losses incurred during war or crisis, it is important that we live above the spoils and festered hatred. Affected regions should at this point look beyond their emotions in the rise of a new and workable cause for the nation. This shouldn’t be perceived as an attempt to wipe off history, even though the subject has been systematically neglected and beyond history, an inclusive way forward in nature should be charted. In my opinion, the new generation should desist from playing the same card as the older generation, or else, the same problems faced today will be transferred to the next generation, as social media has become the adopted site for ethnic brouhaha.

Beyond war, accusations and counter accusations, the new generation should guard itself with wit that will define a workable system in a divergent country like Nigeria. According to Winston Churchill, “No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time”. It is obvious to all that the adopted system of democracy hasn’t done justice to integration, all round development, proportionate representation and growth of the nation. Foundational issues of yesteryears still hold grimly, elevating mediocrity, federal character and ethnic insecurity. It is high time Nigeria moved away from this copy and paste system of democracy and developed the system that will work for all irrespective of size and structure.

Abraham Lincoln, the widely acknowledged father of American democracy defined democracy as, “a government of the people, for the people and by the people”, simply put it is system of government that allows people’s choice and is people involved without threat to collective or individual existence. In other words, the only legitimate format for democracy is recognizing that people’s choice, techniques and style can vary.

Democracy isn’t mathematics where the formula is universal and generally accepted. It can be ascribed to literature; divergent in view, influenced by thought processes and eclectic in answer; a scenario where individual opinion is subjected to personal perception.

Certainly the American style isn’t satisfying and other styles if adopted may fall victim of the same fate. Observing closely, other nations specifically the countries in the West have developed a formula under the democratic umbrella which has worked their nation to success. Nigeria and Nigerians must look beyond the text book formulas and develop a bespoke style that will address our peculiar problems. A system that will obliterate regional insecurity, dispel second classism, address inter and intra ethnic skirmishes and ultimately give rise to development. Perhaps in the nearest future it will make the text books.

The foundation of the 923,768 square kilometers (356,669 sq mi) nation is feeble and until we address the system of governance, no progress will be made. The American system of governance is a diagnosis for their peculiar way of life; Nigeria has to develop a pain reliever to cure its headache. Just like, George Ayittey, prescribed “African Solutions for African problems”.  The structure of a keg defines how it will be held.
