**Introduction**

Transportation is regarded as an index of economic, social and commercial progress of a country, as such the whole structure of a nation’s industry and commerce rests on a well laid foundation of transports system.<sup>1</sup> 

Therefore, the prevailing mode of transportation in a particular territory or country is an attestation to the level of the socio- economic development of that territory or country. <sup>2</sup>In light of the underdevelopment of the rail transport system in Nigeria, the available options for land transportations are cars, commercial buses, trucks, tricycles, motorcycles and bicycles. The most common means of transportation of these options,are the commercial motorcycles. The operation of commercial motorcycles popularly known as “okada”, served as a source of income for many unemployed people, it has also curtailed the number of productivity hours lost due to the traffic situation. Nonetheless, the problems surrounding its operation cannot be ignored. The alarming reports on crimes committed with the use of motorcycles and the inability of law enforcement agencies to avert and control its persistence are part of the reasons for the ban on its operations in some part of Lagos metropolis. <sup>3</sup>Accordingly, the principal purpose of this paper is to ascertain the socio-economic implications of the ban on commercial motorcycle operation in Lagos.


**HISTORY BEHIND THE OPERATION OF COMMERCIAL MOTORCYCLES IN LAGOS**

Initially, motorcycles were essentially used for private purposes. However, the use of motorcycles for commercial purposes began in the mid-eighties due to the lack of adequate coverage and services rendered by public transport system in the wake of population increase in the country. <sup>4</sup>Economic recession and high inflation contributed to the increasing popularity of this mode of transportation among unemployed, increasing the number of motorcycles to almost 200,000 by 2007.<sup>5</sup>  It was strenuous for the average Nigerian employee, in both private and public employment, to access the basic essentials of life i.e. food, water and shelter, let alone have enough to purchase a car or replace an old one. With the growing rate of unemployment, the increase in cost of cars, the deplorable and regressive state of roads and other challenges like traffic jam, the use of motorcycle for commercial purposes became an attractive option.<sup>6</sup>  Consequently, commercial motorcycles filled the service gap created by the lack of adequate public transport system in Lagos. As such, the operation of commercial motorcycles was welcomed and preferred as the best mode of transportation in Lagos metropolis.


**ADVANTAGES OF COMMERCIAL MOTORCYCLE OPERATION**

Undoubtedly, Commercial Motorcycle Operation has its merits and demerits. The services rendered by the commercial motorcycles are relatively affordable and accessible, thus making it appealing to the average Lagos citizens. Among other benefits commercial motorcycles are valuable on demand because they have the ability to maneuver, travel on bad roads and transport passengers to relatively long distances in Lagos. It can also reach the most distant and remote places in Lagos. These attributes contributed to its frequent use as it saves money and time for many commuters. They also take passengers to their doorsteps, unlike the commercial buses which only take passengers to the bus-stops.<sup>7</sup>

For an unemployed person looking for a means of earning income, purchasing a motorcycle is a more reasonable option as it is much cheaper than the cost of operation and maintenance of commercial buses. Furthermore, the most significant advantage of commercial motorcycle operation is the employment opportunities it provides for the people. According to TC insights there are 14,000 employees in the bike hailing companies ( Max.ng, Gokada and Oride by Opay. As it has been stated, the rise in unemployment rate coupled with the poor economic situation and the deplorable conditions of roads in Nigeria significantly influenced the rise in the use of motorcycles as means of transportation. 


**DISADVANTAGES OF COMMERCIAL MOTORCYCLE OPERATION** 

The popular elitist and government sentiments are that many of these bikers are involved in criminal activities which is one of the reasons for the ban placed on the commercial motorcycles in the city of Lagos. However, survey has shown that most of the respondents(91.0%) have not been robbed by bandits operating on motorcycles, while 9.0% have been a victim.<sup>8</sup> As accidents involving motorcycles have increased over the years, most of these accidents were reported to have been as a result driver’s negligence and chaotic traffic. Many drivers are reckless with little or no regards for road signs, unlicensed and not properly trained. Several of the drivers drive under the influence of drugs and alcohol. 


**THE EFFECT OF THE BAN ON SOCIO-ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES.**

Since the announcement of the ban on commercial motorcycles in some part of Lagos, residents and other stakeholders have been counting their losses and are unsatisfied with the policy. Having reviewed the merits and demerits of commercial motorcycle, it is apparent that the ban will affect the socio-economic activities of the city if good measures are not put in place by the government this is because the ban will result in inflation of cost of transportation, the increase of the rate of unemployment. It may also be argued that the crime rates will be higher as drivers who used their commercial motorcycle operations as a source of income, no longer have this source. This ban will also increase the traffic congestions and also increase hardship face by public transport users.


**THE EFFECTS OF THE BAN ON THE ENVIRONMENT.**

Majority of these commercial motorcycles are not properly maintained and serviced, most of these machines exude fumes into the air thereby causing the air to be polluted and making the environment unfit for human. It has been established that motorcycles on the average emit 1.5 and 5 times more carbon-monoxide and hydro-carbon gases per kilometer<sup>9</sup>, this however  increases the danger that can be caused by fumes  in the environment. Therefore, it is safe to say that the ban placed on motorcycles will reduce air pollution.
 However, it could be argued that motor vehicles also exude offensive fumes and thereby still causing pollution problems as highlighted above in the state. Hence, the explanation by the State Government that ban of motorcycles was also for environmental reasons are unjustified.


**CONCLUSION**

The ban on such a small-scale business for many, without provision of adequate means of transportation for the citizens and employment for the motorcycle drivers by the government shows a lack of forward thinking by the state government. The government has reportedly approved the release of 65 buses to help run the areas affected by the ban. However, it is highly unlikely that these buses would be able to transport the same number of people the commercial motorcycles transported daily.

One of the major reasons given by the current administration for the motorcycle ban is that it is often used in criminal activities. While this may be true, the pertinent question is, will crime truly be eradicated following the ban? Are all commercial motorcycle operators’ involved in the carrying out of the crimes? Will the government also ban cars if rate of crimes committed with cars increase? A preferable solution would have been the provision of motorcycles for the security agencies so they can skillfully ensure the arrest of such criminals. 

However, study shows that the use of helmets significantly reduced deaths and brain injuries from motorcycle accidents.<sup>10</sup> If the commercial motorcycles were properly regulated and made to wear helmets, it would reduce casualties should they get into accidents. The problem with this is the poor enforcement and corruption among road traffic enforcement agents who ignore traffic misdemeanors for a token. 

In conclusion, the relationship between unemployment and crime is no joke and this ban will only create more problems if adequate measures are not put in place to mitigate the consequences. Lagos already has an unemployment rate of 14% according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics which will definitely go higher as a result of the ban. Thinking that buses will solve the traffic problem caused by placing a ban on motorcycles or tricycles, is unrealistic because they were initially to solve the same problem. Buses have fixed routes and cannot operate in the inner routes, which is why motorcycles became popular and accepted.
