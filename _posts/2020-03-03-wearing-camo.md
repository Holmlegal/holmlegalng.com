Few months ago I came across a video on the popular social media app twitter, in that video a civilian was being kicked and punished for wearing a camouflage by a soldier. The video clouded my mind with several questions. Is it illegal? If yes, what is the position of the law and what is the punishment? 

Are relatives of any military personnel permitted to wear it even when they do not belong to the military and are they exempted from the punishments if they do wear it? And the last question is who can punish any civilian found wanting?

Is wearing the Army Camouflage illegal? 

The Law and Punishment: Yes, it is illegal to wear the army camouflage in Nigeria.

Section 110 (1) Criminal Code Act 1990 states that any person who unlawfully wearing the uniform of forces not being a person serving in any of the armed forces of Nigeria, wears the uniform or any part of the uniform of such forces or any of the armed dress having the appearance or bearing any of the regimental or other distinctive marks is such uniform is guilty of an offence and is liable to imprisonment for one month or a fine of ten Naira unless he proves that he has the permission of the President or of the Governor of a state to wear such uniform or dress, badge or mark or to carry such token.

However, there is an exception to the above rule. The above stated will not apply if the uniform is worn in the course of a stage play or is worn in any bonafide public entertainment.
In Lagos state ,section 77 of the criminal law of Lagos state holds the same position as Section 110(1) of the criminal code but the difference is the punishment in Lagos which says such civilian is liable to imprisonment for three years.

This however means that the only way you can can confidently wear your camouflage t-shirt or trousers is if you have the permission of the President or Governor of your state.

Are relatives of any military personnel permitted to wear it even when they do not belong to the military and are they exempted from the punishments that should follow?

Clearly, following the section stated above relatives of military personnelâ€™s are not covered because the law says only members of the military and those permitted by the President or Governor have the right to wear the camouflage except for those wearing it for stage play or bonafide entertainment purposes. They are also not exempted from the punishment.

Who can punish any civilian found wanting? The law is clear. As far as the above stated section is concerned, it is clear that only the court of law can punish civilians who go against the law by wearing camouflage. Making civilians undress in public or beating them and causing pain is inhuman and an infringement of their fundamental human right to dignity of human person as stated in Section 34 of the 1999 Constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria.

In conclusion, the importance of the Nigerian army cannot be overlooked but they should refrain from harassing civilians who wear camouflage, anybody who unlawfully wears the camouflage should be punished accordingly. Erring military officers should be punished accordingly as stated in the Armed Forces Act.
